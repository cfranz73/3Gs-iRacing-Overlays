```
I want to add a new feature to the 3Gs iRacing Overlays project.

Feature description:
[Describe the feature]

Use case:
[Explain why this feature is needed]

Technical considerations:
- Data sources needed: [iRacing API, telemetry, etc.]
- Update frequency: [real-time/periodic]
- User interaction: [if any]

Questions:
1. What's the best approach to implement this?
2. Are there existing libraries or tools I should use?
3. What are potential performance impacts?
4. How should this integrate with existing overlay architecture?

Please provide:
- Architecture recommendations
- Code examples or pseudocode
- Best practices for this type of feature
- Testing strategy
```

## Research Prompt for Perplexity AI

Use this template specifically for Perplexity AI searches:

```
Research the following topic related to iRacing overlay development:

Topic: [Your research topic]

Focus areas:
1. [Specific aspect 1]
2. [Specific aspect 2]
3. [Implementation considerations]

Please provide:

```

## Tips for Effective Prompts

1. **Be Specific**: Include exact error messages, technology versions, and specific requirements
2. **Provide Context**: Mention you're working with iRacing overlays and this project
3. **State Your Goal**: Clearly explain what you're trying to achieve
4. **Include Constraints**: Mention any limitations (browser compatibility, performance needs, etc.)
5. **Ask for Examples**: Request code examples in your preferred language
6. **Request Citations**: Ask for links to official documentation when possible
7. **Iterate**: If the first response isn't quite right, refine your prompt with more details
